            <p><h2>Imagine that you are pranking your friend. While your friend is sleeping, you take his room, put it on a rocket ship and send him far into space, away from planets and other celestial bodies. Let the rocket accelerate. When he wakes up and gets out of bed, everything will seem normal. This happens because the rocket is accelerating, so he feels himself being pulled toward the floor of his room, just as if he were being pulled down by gravity. Your friend, having just learned about Galileo the night before, decides he wants to recreate Galileo's experiment. He takes a heavy stone and an apple and throws them from the same height at the same time. They hit the floor at the same time, and your friend, happy that he understood Galileo, decides to reward himself and take a nap, blissfully unaware that he is actually on an accelerating rocket in the center of space. From afar, you watched it all unfold. From your point of view, why did the stone and the apple fall to the floor at the same time?</h2></p>
